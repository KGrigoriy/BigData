Partition vs Bucket
Bucketing is similar to partitioning, but partitioning creates a directory for each partition, whereas bucketing distributes data across a fixed number of buckets by a hash on the bucket value. Tables can be bucketed on more than one value and bucketing can be used with or without partitioning.
Bucket vs Sort
Since sorting is not global, there is no benefits form sortBy.
